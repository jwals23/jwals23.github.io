I am an Academic Technology Specialist at <a href="https://emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emory University</a> in Atlanta, Georgia, where I  also completed my Ph.D. in the <a href="http://philosophy.emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Philosophy</a> in 2024. I approach the humanities with a technological background and technology with a humanistic background, which mostly just means that I am annoying to both of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the two cultures</a>.

Outside of work, I am an [avid reader](/reading/) and [music fan](/listening/).

This site is a work in progress, mostly to play around with GitHub Pages.
